### Creating the table in SQL

After completing the survey, I used this code to create the table in a new SQL schema that I called "movies." Non-responses were coded using SQL's NULL function.
```
create table moviedf (
	Person varchar(255),
    Inside_Out_2 int,
    Wicked int,
    Nosferatu int,
    A_Complete_Unknown int,
    Moana_2 int,
    Joker_2 int
    );
Insert Into moviedf (Person, Inside_Out_2, Wicked, Nosferatu, A_Complete_Unknown, Moana_2, Joker_2)
Values ('Darren', 4, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1),
		('Micah', 4, 5, 3, 4, 3, 1),
        ('Lisa', 5, 3, 2, null, 1, 2),
        ('Ben', 2, null, 1, null, null, 5),
        ('Stan', 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4);
```
### Importing the table into R

There were several new pacakges that I installed in trying to figure out how to import the table from SQL into R. By connecting to the database on SQL, tables can be imported with the dbReadTable function.
```
install.packages("RMySQL")
install.packages("DBI")
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)
connection <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),
                        dbname = "movies",
                        dbhost = "localhost",
                        port = 3306,
                        user = "root",
                          password = "*******")

```
```
moviesdf <- dbReadTable(connection, "moviedf")
print(moviesdf)
```

Unfortunately the code does not run in RMarkdown while I have the asterisks for my password, but I confirmed in the console that the table is generated correctly.
